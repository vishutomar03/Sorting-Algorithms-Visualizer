    Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
</h1>

## This repo is an attempt to help in learning popular sorting algorithms by visualization

Helps to

- understand the working of different sorting algorithm like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, etc
- check total swaps required
- check total comparisions
- compare algorithms side by side
- know the time taken (time is just an approximate unit for comparision)

Features

- Sort any given array
- Alter the speed of sorting 
- Generate random array of numbers
- Change the size of an array
